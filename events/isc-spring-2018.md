### What is InnerSource?
InnerSource takes the lessons learned from developing open source software and applies them to the way companies develop software internally. As developers have become accustomed to working on world class open source software, there is a strong desire to bring those practices back inside the firewall and apply them to software that companies may be reluctant to release. For companies building mostly closed source software, InnerSource can be a great tool to help break down silos, encourage internal collaboration, accelerate new engineer on-boarding, and identify opportunities to contribute software back to the open source world.
 
### What is the InnerSource Commons?
The InnerSource Commons ([InnerSourceCommons.org](http://innersourcecommons.org)) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from over sixty companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule)), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.
  
### Who should attend?
The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer.  The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organizationâ€”whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.
   
### What will I get from this event?
The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:

* Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption
* Share your experiences and get help with your challenges
* Network, network, network! The InnerSource Commons is an excellent place to network with likeminded people, all of whom are passionate about making InnerSource a success in their respective organizations!
