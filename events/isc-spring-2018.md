<b>Ten years of inner source case studies and our conclusions</b>
</p>

<p>
In 2006, I introduced inner source to SAP. After becoming a professor, my group helped further companies introduce inner source. Using three generations of projects, we report about our experiences and how we turn those into a practical handbook for inner source governance.

<p>
<b>Building Trust with Intentional Relationship Design</b>
</p>

<p>
Disagreements and misunderstandings are common even in the most high-performing organizations. Fortunately, a potential solution offers us a path forward from vagueness and confusion: intentional relationship design. Taken from the therapeutic profession, IRD enables us to establish clarity in our work relationships early on so we can avoid conflict later. In this talk, I'll show how you can use it to establish expectations, set boundaries and uncover communication preferences to build trust and harmony—especially as your teams aim to InnerSource.

<b>Karsten Gerloff</b>

<p>
Having worked at the intersection of technology, policy and law for more than a decade, Karsten Gerloff is helping Siemens make use of the full potential of Open Source Software. Before joining Siemens in 2015, he worked for six years as president of the Free Software Foundation Europe (https://fsfe.org), where he focused on European technology policy and advocacy. At the United Nations University in Maastricht (The Netherlands), he researched the social and economic implications of Open Source Software.
</p>

<p><b>Committing (to) change: The Siemens Software Management System</b></p>

<p>
The Siemens Inner Source platform started as a way for one division to maintain a standard stack across its product range. From these beginnings, it quickly grew into something much bigger: A state-of-the-art development environment, a tool to build platforms within the company. It also became a highly visible example for a collaborative, agile way of working within Siemens. In this keynote, we will review the platform´s history and the key reasons for its success so far, as well as challenges past and present.

### What is InnerSource?

InnerSource takes the lessons learned from developing open source software and applies them to the way companies develop software internally. As developers have become accustomed to working on world class open source software, there is a strong desire to bring those practices back inside the firewall and apply them to software that companies may be reluctant to release. For companies building mostly closed source software, InnerSource can be a great tool to help break down silos, encourage internal collaboration, accelerate new engineer on-boarding, and identify opportunities to contribute software back to the open source world.
 
### What is the InnerSource Commons?

The InnerSource Commons ([InnerSourceCommons.org](http://innersourcecommons.org)) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from over sixty companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule)), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.
  
### Who should attend?

The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer.  The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organization—whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.
   
### What will I get from this event?

The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:

* Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption
* Share your experiences and get help with your challenges
* Network, network, network! The InnerSource Commons is an excellent place to network with likeminded people, all of whom are passionate about making InnerSource a success in their respective organizations!
